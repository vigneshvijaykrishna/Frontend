# Discovered Components

This is an auto-generated list of components discovered by [nuxt/components](https://github.com/nuxt/components).

You can directly use them in pages and other components without the need to import them.

**Tip:** If a component is conditionally rendered with `v-if` and is big, it is better to use `Lazy` or `lazy-` prefix to lazy load.

- `<Navigation>` | `<navigation>` (components/Navigation.vue)
- `<MenuAdminMenu>` | `<menu-admin-menu>` (components/menu/AdminMenu.vue)
- `<MenuUserMenu>` | `<menu-user-menu>` (components/menu/UserMenu.vue)
